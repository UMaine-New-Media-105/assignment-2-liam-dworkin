I will add updates as the projects are turned in. Right now Parts 1,2,3 are included which all include using functions to create some level of composition 
outside of purely calling in each piece of code in 'draw' by calling back certain prescribed functions for something such as a sprite that can then have different 
variables assigned to them such as size, color, location, etc...
