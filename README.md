I will add updates as the projects are turned in. Right now Parts 1,2,3 are included which all include using functions to create some level of composition 
outside of purely calling in each piece of code in 'draw' by calling back certain prescribed functions for something such as a sprite that can then have different 
variables assigned to them such as size, color, location, etc...

Part 4 is slightly different. It is to create a flag from two nation's flags that share your initials. My initials are "L" and "D" so I chose Libya and DPRK or
North Korea. It can be my statement on the failure of American foreign policy. I created 4 funtions: one for rectangles, one for circles, one for stars, and just
to make all the drawing function calling I made a separate function for one vertical rectangle. I used all the RGB values of the actual digital flags of the two 
nations, mixing them around to create a disjointed blocking effect horizontally as both flags are horizontal with different block heights. Skewed towards the right
I added the star motif of both flags with a slight variation in color. 

I did have to research the code for the star function though I rewrote it out and added some new functionality while removing certain parts from the reference page
I had used.
